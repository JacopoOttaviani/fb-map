fb-map.py, v0.1
A python script which creates a dot file of your facebook friends mutual friendships graph. 
Based on facebook API.
You can go multithreading to gain more speed, but you may risk to get banned by fb. 
Default is mono-threading. Set threadsN variable to add more threads. 
You could need to sleep after an API request (set the sleeping value for that).

In order to use fb-map, you need:
1. NetworkX, http://networkx.lanl.gov
2. pyfacebook, http://github.com/sciyoshi/pyfacebook/
3. a facebook API key, http://developers.facebook.com/

--- USAGE: ---
$ python fb-map.py

then login in facebook and press enter. After that, many browser windows will popup 
(depending on how many errors raise and how many threads you're running).

Have fun and if you have any feedback just drop me a line.
